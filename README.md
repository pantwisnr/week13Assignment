#week 13 Intro to React.js




-----------
CHALLENGES
-----------

----------------------------------------------------------------
[eslint] Plugin "react" was conflicted between "package.json Â» eslint-config-react-app
----------------------------------------------------------------
-> This was solved by opening the package.json file and then type ctrl + s for it to disappear.

-> When i  edited any code and refresh it, the same eror disappears. i was working from a parent directore that had the react directory 
 So i have to open the package.json file and then type ctrl + s, after that i closed the enitre vs code window and cd into the actual react directory and not the parent directory. and the error never came back
